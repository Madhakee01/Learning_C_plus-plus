Notes on Programming Development


 Programming Paradigms/Methodologies?

Monolithic Programming:

- the entire program will be a single-file based , one single source file. 
- the problem is that only a single programmer can write this. Not suitable for large programs and team work


Procedural Programming:

- Multiple programmers can be used.
- Use functions, main() function and reuse code. Like C program
- the benefits: you can use it in multiple files

Modular Programming:

- using structures and functions
- other features include that of procedural programming


Object-Oriented:

- everything is inside a class - from functions and methods, and data 
- we create new instances of the class
- more reusability of class

Difference in programming paradigms is the structure of the code. 


The easiest method to write programs is using C++


What is an Algorithm?

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a computational program.

- Algorithm is converted into Program. If you know how to solve a problem, you can design algorithms


Algorithm is Psuedocode.

Program is syntax of a programming language.

- we use existing algorithms and write programs to manipulate. So it is vice to learn how to design algorithms first.


Example algorithm and program.


Algorithm:

Algorithm Average(list, n)
{
	sum <- 0
	for each element in x in 
	Begin
		sum <- sum + x
	End;
	
	avg <- sum/n

	return 0
}

Program:

Float average(int L[], int n)
{
	float sum = 0.0;
	
	for(I=0, I < n, I++)
	{
		sum = sum + L[I];
	}
	float avg= sum/n;

	return avg;

}


What is a Flow Char?

- used for monolithic programming
 - contains elements: start/stop, input/output, process, condition and flow of data


Steps for Program Development and Execution?

c++ ide : Turbo c++, Xcode, devcpp, eclipse and visual studio, and codeblocks

1. Editing 
	you write the program in any editor or ide
2. Compiling 
3. Linking Library
4. Loading 
5. Execution
