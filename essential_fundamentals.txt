Essential Fundamentals of C++

1. How Computers Work?
	Block Diagram 

Central Processing Unit (CPU)
	
		- the heart of the computers are CPU, that is broken down into Arithmetic unit (AU)       and Control Unit (CU). 

Arithmetic Unit - process logic
Control Unit - controls other process and utilities them 


Hardisk 

- contains files: program files(.exe files) and data files (my.text, music files)


Main Memory (primary) 

When you want to run a program, the hard disk passes the files to the main memory and then the CPU process main memory line by line to execute the instruction.


Input Devices(memory is input buffer) / Output Devices (memory is output buffer)


The computer is based on Binary Number System

8 bits instruction 

0 is false 
1 is true


Introduction to Number System:


- Binary {0,1}, base 2
- Octal {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, base 8
- Decimal {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, base 10
- Hexadecimal {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A, B, C, D, E, F, base = 16

What is a program?

The steps to perform a task. For example evaluating an expression using an calculator. In our case, a programmable calculator.


Low Level and High Level Languages?

MachineLanguage - Binary and low-level 
Assembly Language - low level

High Level languages - c, c++, java, python, c#, VB, and etc.
