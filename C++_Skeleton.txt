The skeleton of C++.


First PrograM: 

- You save the files as .cpp. 



Always include a #include <iostream>

Using namespace std; // have to use this to not include std:: 

//main function.

int main()
{

	std::cout<<"hello world";


Return 0;
}


Cout = Control out to output something to the screen in C++
Cin = for input from the user

The shift operator << is an insertion operator.
The shift operation >> to read in values from the user



Writing my first Program?

Every program has an input, process, and a output.

 
Program to add two numbers. 

Start -> print enter 2 number, read a, b -> c <- a + b -> print 'addition = ", c -> end program


Algorithm ADD

Begin
	Print "Enter 2 no"
	Read a, b
	c <- a + b
	  
	print addition is "c"

END


Program:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

Int main()
{
	int a, b, c, ;
	cout <<"enter two number";
	cin>>a>>b;
	c = a + b;
	cout << "the result is " << c;
	
	return 0;
}



Data types: int, string. 

A program to read in a name with multiple words


#include <iostream>
Using namespace std;

int main()
{
	string name;
	cout << "May I have your name";
	gettine (can, name)l // get line to read multiple words
	cout <<" your name I s" << name;

	return 0;
}
