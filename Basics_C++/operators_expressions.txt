Operators and Expressions


Arithmetic = +,-,* /, %

Relational = <,<=, >, >=, ==

Logical = &&, !, !!, 

Bitwise = &, !,  ~. ^

Incremen/Decrement = ++, --

Assignment = , =


Examples

Int a = 13, b = 5;

Float c = 23.4

C = (float)a/b;

C = a % b

Char Key = 'K', b = 5, c;

Precedence and Expressions 


Operator Assumed Precedent (only few examples)

()->3
*,/, %, -> 2
+, - -> 1

 Ex expressions
	x = a+b*c-d/e
	x = (a+b) * (c-d)/e



Example Math Formula's 


Area of Triangle  a = 1/2bh

In c++ a = (b*h)/2 

Perimeter of Rectangle = p = 2 * (l+B)


Sum of n terms = s = n*(n+1)/2

#include <cmath>

Quadratic formula e = b + sqrt(b*b -4*a*c)



Program for Area of Triangle

Start -> print'Enter base and height" Read b, h -> a = (b*h)/2 -> print "Area is ", a -> stop 

Algorithm Area
Begin 
	print " Enter base and height"
	Read b, h
	a <- (b*h)/2
	print "Area is ", a
END 

C++ program

#inclue <iostream>
Using namespace std;

Int main()
{
	
	float a, b, h;
	cout <<"enter base and height";
	cin >>b>>h;
	a = (b*h)/2;
	cout << "Area is " << a

	return 0
