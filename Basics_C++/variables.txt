Variables?


Variables store of some data type stores values. 

For ex. Int rollno; 

	rollno = 10; // when you run the program the variable gets initialized in memory


	char group = 'A'
	
	float price = 5.43f; // to declare a float value, if you don't write then it will be read as double

TO declare variable names: camelcase and meaningful names
