This section is about data types in C++


Why Data Types?

Types of Data: 
	Numeric: int, float
	Character/Alphabetic(125-A): character, string

The data types have to be stores in memory for it to work


1 byte = 8 bits (0-255 numbers are allowed to store)

Variables are used for storing data.

All the Data types are availables in C++.

Primitive(compiler provided) - Integral (no decimal point), boolean ( true or false), and Floating point -> float and double

User Define Data Types:enum, structure, union and class

Derived : array, pointer and reference


Datta Type Size and Ranges:

int, 2 0r 4
float, 4,, -3.4e^-38 to 3.9e38
double, 8, 1.7 e^-308 to 1.7e308
Char,  -128 to 127
Bool , undefined, true or false


Modifiers 

Unsigned int (0-65535) - both positive and negative 
 
Unsigned char (0-255)

Long int - 4 bytes, 8 bytes

Long double  -- 10 bytes
